## Introduction
This organisation is a storage place for all my projects that I have completed as part of FreeCodeCamps online coding courses. 

Currently this contains the projects for the FrontEnd Development Certificate, which is fully completed. 
While not actively being worked on this organisation may be updated as I slowly work through the other courses.
