## Introduction
This organisation is a storage place for all my projects that I have completed as part of FreeCodeCamps online coding courses. 

Currently this contains the projects for the FrontEnd Development Certificate, which is fully completed. 
While not actively being worked on this organisation may be updated as I slowly work through the other courses. 

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
